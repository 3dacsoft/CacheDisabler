# CacheDisabler
DOS app to disable/enable CPU caching on older 486/Pentium PCs to slow performance for games written for 386 or older PCs. It is helpful when using an MT-32 synthesizer on a 486 or newer PC that sends SysEx commands to fast for the MT-32 to process (which is precisely why it was written).

Disclaimer: I wrote this years ago and I think I lost the most recent work to a dead hard drive. This may not work or even build. I'll get back to finishing it some day. Use at your own risk.
